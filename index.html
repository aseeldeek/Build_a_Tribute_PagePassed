            <h2> Who is Gojo Satoru ? </h2>
         <p>Gojo Satoru, often referred to as Gojo is one of the main characters of Jujutsu Kaisen.
            He is a renowned sorcerer, well known among both, the sorcerer community as well as the curses. 
            He is acknowledged as a threat and often called the most powerful sorcerer alive. Even Geto Suguru,
            who is one of the major antagonists of the series, is wary of his powers. When Jogou, one of the curses
            expresses his wish to battle Satoru, Geto warns as he assures him that he will definitely die if he tries to fight him.
            Even Sukuna understands the outrageous limits of his powers as he was easily overpowered by Gojo when they first met. </p>
